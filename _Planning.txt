First thoughts on assignment:
What do i need to do:
    - Build an in game logic in a js file
        - that has to include all the objects that create the asteroid game
            - spaceship, asteroids, saucers (ships that attack), point system, life counter (maybe not really class needed at all)
        - a game loop that describes how the game should be played
    - create a way to render in a classic way and also modern
        - start with modern --> simplification in a classic mode through a switch triggered
    - create a hud
        - during game: display amount of lifes, highscores
        - before game: start button, switch to change rendering modes
        - game over state: back to main menu button, play again button, maybe even log highscore ever achieved


-- Date: 15.11.2023
First steps made:
- create variables and objects that outline the game.
- try to figure out what functions can be written so tha the main method that runs the game can be simplified (divide and conquer)
- creation and movement defined of the spaceship and the other objects to a certain extend


-- Date 16.11.2023
defined spaceship and asteroids with movement and also other behaviours

--Date: 29.11.2023
worked on the saucer and defined movement, spawning and shooting behaviour

--Date 05.12.2023
- fix fetching of models and do that over just one fetch method that can be called for all json files!
- start the rendering so i can test my already written methods
- fixed the movement of the spaceship
- done adaptation in new folder

--Date 10.12.2023
- in new file fixed spaceship movement and done wrapping
- started writing for asteroids spawning and fetching of the models

-- Date 19.12.2023
- fixed rendering in other environment with scenegraphes
- made ship rotate mathematically but not yet visually --> movement works but not visually
- loaded in first asteroid stationary in the center --> figure out how to place them randomly --> create an asteroid class so we can bind the 
    coordinates to the visual object --> then make it move randomly --> this.transform[12] and [13] in both the movements

-- Date 26.12.2023
- made spaceship rotate and move appropriately
- started the rendering and movement process of the asteroids --> does not work yet

-- Date 28.12.2023
- tried to make the asteroids actually work --> still not done
- tried to get the background to be starry --> want to just add the space_background file over the colour buffer

-- Date 29.12.2023
- added saucer file and functionalities
- movement does not work correctly yet --> moves left right way to quick that it actually reaches the end of the screen 
     --> set timeout to delay the iterations
     
- saucer always placed in the middle --> not correct as i want it to be randomly placed on the x and y axis --> x axis is randomly but the y is not

-- Date 30.12.2023
- fix movement of saucer and placement --> done runs on x axis consistently until hitting a screenlimit and then inverts direction
    - through this.transform[13] in animationCallback placed it randomly on y axis as well

- get one asteroid to move freely at least --> moves as intended right now --> fix it so it actually spawns at a random location on the screen within
    screenlimits

- try to figure out how to render more than 1 object of an array --> asteroids, saucers, lasers

-- Date 04.01.2024
- figure out how to load images and assigns as textures

-- Date 08.01.2024
- implement life system for player
- assign texture to spaceship
- implement hit detection

-- Date 09.01.2024
- implement textures --> spaceship is the only thing not wrapping on the object right

-- Date 10.01.2024
- fix the asteroids to spawn randomly and not on one spot! --> they do tihi
- make the asteroids move properly --> they do tihi
- create background plane for starry background --> found picture i want to use

--Date 12.01.2024
- place background
- come up with idea for hit detection that might work and test it

-- Date 14.01.2024
- make spaceship reset location after being hit
- fix spaceship shooting
- come up with idea how asteroids can split up and spawn 2 of the smaller size if being hit

--Date 15.01.2024
- spaceship cooldown on hyperdrive countdown function
- asteroid splitting definition
- create second kind of saucers

--Date 16.01.2024
- fix the asteroid spawning so its in the scene graph
- do the same with the saucers

-- Date 20.01.2024
- attempt to fix saucer spawning for the 10 second requirement

-- Date 23.01.2024
- fix saucers speed
- fix laser shooting
- try getting an overview to get the main masks --> html start screen etc.

-- Date 24.01.2024
- integrate clear node distinctions so they can be removed --> system needs to know which one to remove
    --> add a + i to each node creation in a node for loop

-- Date 26.01.2024
- write method to remove nodes from the scene graph --> done just implement --> does not work properly
- improve collision detection --> simplify so i can remove the nodes easier --> improved
- integrate a highscore system --> after shooting the asteroids and saucers --> highscore is set at 0 but couldnt fix the collision stuff so cant be increased yet 

-- Date 29.01.2024
- implement attract mode

-- Date 30.01.2024
- fix lasers not stopping at end of screen
- fix attract mode into gameplay Mode switch --> switch works but attract mode isnt showing properly

-- Date 01.02.2024
- implement the hit detection and make the asteroids and saucers pop out of the scene graph

-- 04.02.2024
- fix the despawn of the asteroids and saucers --> fixed
- implement waves so the game escalates til failure --> fix while loop --> so it spawns mathematically now but not visually.. work on it after exam

-- 06.02.2024
- fix the wave spawning --> fixed it through making the asteroid spawning a method and calling it in the render loop!!!!! (super glad)

-- 09.02.2024
- make saucers shoot lasers at random locations --> not done at all

-- 11.02.2024:
- fixed attract mode and gameplay mode transition --> just implement game over mode and should work now! 
    --> UI transition from game over into attract to do
- implement the only small saucers after 10k points! --> done

-- 12.02.2024:
- implement game over mode --> finish that tmrw
- fix the movement problems of the asteroids when they are destroyed --> done
- make funciton that changes the indices slightly of the geometry of the asteroids to make them look distinct --> distinct between sizes!
- implement extra life after 10k points     --> done!

-- 13.02.2024:
- finish game Over mode! --> do tmrw
- make saucers shoot            --> shoots at random location but only one --> maybe fix the directed one
- make the asteroids split      --> in the asteroid hit detection in combination with the lasers!
- start writing report

-- 14.02.2024
- finish game over Mode --> done
- write report

-- 115.02.2024
- finish report and hand in assignment
